## Overview

After these last two years of eating at home, aren't you bored of the same old meals? What's for Dinner is a website that takes the planning out meals. Pick from a list of sides, mains, and desserts to create a meal, or pick the "entire meal" option to see a full three course meal. Once you have made a selection, click the "let's cook" button to see some meal suggestions. So sit back, relax and "LET'S COOK!"
